# 13-Burger-Logger
A burger logger to log the burgers you eat!

## STEPS

1. created all the necessary files and ran npm i
2. wrote code in all the files using previous activities as examples.
3. worked out bugs. A typo was preventing the create and delete routes from working. still trying to figure out why update will not work.
